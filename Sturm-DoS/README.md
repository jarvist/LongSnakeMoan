Further development on this Stat Mech + linear Tight Binding (via Sturm Sequences) approach to 
Density of States of disordered organic materials has moved to a seperate repository: 

https://github.com/jarvist/Teclo

Briefly the method is:

* Given an arbitrary effective potential energy landscape U=f(\theta)
* Integrate (monte carlo direct sampling) to get a (statistical mechanical) partition function, Z=\sum e^{U/kBT}
* Use this partition function to generate random samples of \theta
* Use a model for the transfer integral between two neighbouring units (i.e. monomers in a polymer chain, J~cos(theta)) to build a tight-binding Hamiltonian
* If tri-diagonal, use linear scaling Sturm sequencies to generate a historgrammed DoS
* If not - currently just standard linear algebra methods. Though perhaps Arrowhead methods for 2D/3D systems in the future?

Method developed in these codes are discussed in these talk slides, but I'm afraid it's pretty incoherent without the talk (and not much better with...).

The only published application of this method we applied it to the P3HT system, treating the P3HT as non-interacting chains. Unfortunately, we found that it didn't agree particularly well with the detailed Molecular Dynamics of the rest of the paper. I suspect this is due to the poor model for the inter-monomer potential (we need an effective potential that includes steric hindrance + entropic effects of the sidechains).
